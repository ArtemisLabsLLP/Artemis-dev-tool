Project Artemis is an Open Sourced developer tool for single endpoint testing of GraphQL queries for Apollo Client. The web based extension is best used for React and Express products and applications in development mode, and is available at the chrome store. 

Artemis Dev Tool can be downloaded in the Google Chrome Web Store, and accessed in the inspector window. For Web Applications that use Apollo Client GraphQL schemas, query endpoint testing and cache management can be done in real time for instant engineering feedback without the need for backend resolver testing.

At Artemis Labs, we believe in creating adaptive solutions that facilitates continuous test driven query testing, mutability, and introspection as we make the shift away from antiquated RESTful architectures into the era of decentralization, focusing on technologies like Apollo GraphQL. 

Once the extension is downloaded and set on Developer mode, it will be in the web app's inspector window, and allows custom detection of GraphQL apps in which client queries exist, time travel, visualizer and query snapshot. 


Project Artemis is sitll in Beta, a subset project of OS-Labs.
