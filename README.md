# Artemis-dev-tool

Project Artemis is an Open Sourced developer tool for single endpoint testing of GraphQL queries for Apollo Client. THe web based extension is best used for React and Express products and applications in development mode, and is available at the chrome store. Here at Artemis Labs, we believe in creating adaptive solutions that facilitates continuous test driven query testing, mutability, and introspection as we make the shift away from antiquated RESTful architectures into the era of decentralization, focusing on technologies like Apollo GraphQL. 

Once the extension is downloaded and set on Developer mode, it will be in the web app's inspector window, and allows custom detection of GraphQL apps in which client queries exist


Project Artemis is sitll in Beta, a subset project of OS-Labs.
